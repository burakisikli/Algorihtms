# Midterm 2 Sample Questions

## Question 2 
Suppose that we are given an instance of the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem on a graph G which has
positive distinct edge costs. Let T be a minimum (cost) spanning tree for G. Now we make a new graph G’
which is almost exactly G, with the only exception that the edge costs are squared. (In other words: each
edge e of G having edge cost c-e appears in G’ as an edge with edge cost c-e2 and there is no other edge in G’).
Question: Must T be still a minimum spanning tree for G’?
Answer: (Yes/No):
Why: (Explain)

## Solution 2:
True, squaring the weights of the edges in a weighted graph will not change the minimum spanning tree. Assume the opposite to obtain a contradiction. If the minimum spanning tree changes then at least one edge from the old graph G in the old minimum spanning tree T must be replaced by a new edge in tree T' from the graph G' with squared edge weights. The new edge from G' must have a lower weight than the edge from G.
This implies that there exists some weights C1 and C2 such that C1 < C2 and C12 >= C22. This is a contradiction.


## Question 3
You are supposed to determine whether there is a path of length K or less from a given starting point to
the given end point in a 2D maze. Can this problem solved efficiently? How would you solve this problem?
